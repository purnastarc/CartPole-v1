Deep Q-Network Model -  The created model will be able to play the CartPole-v1 game in OpenAI Gym  :

Created a Q-Network model and Target Network model using Artificial Neural Network.
Manually Implemented Experience Replay-Buffer and Epsilon greedy action-selection from scratch.
Dataset for training is generated using Experience Replay-Buffer and Target Network.
Then the Q-Network model is trained on the generated dataset.
The trained Q-Network model successfully scored an average of more than 195 points in the CartPole-v1 game. Which is considered to be solved.
